# Antenna-Pattern-Simulation
Using Matlab to Realize Some Antenna Pattern Simulation in Mobile Communication Engineering

## Numerical simulation using MATLAB software:
(1) Draw a three-dimensional radiation pattern of a single symmetrical dipole antenna, observe and analyze the change of its lobe as l/Î» continues to increase.
(2) An antenna array (linear array + two-dimensional area array) composed of several full-wave symmetrical dipole antennas, draw its radiation pattern, observe and analyze its three-dimensional pattern and A fancy pattern of radiation field distribution on the far-field observation surface of a vertical main beam.
